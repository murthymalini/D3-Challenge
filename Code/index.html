            Census Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Demographics
          </h2>

          <p>There is a clear correlation between poverty and healthcare, with the
            richest and poorest states at opposite corners of scatter plot.
          </p>

          <p>There is a probable correlation between and age and healthcare coverage.  The
            younger states do tend to have more lacking healthcare.  However, with the median age
            of so many states being in the mid-30s, this is actually a small sample of different ages.
          </p>

          <p>There is only a small correlation between poverty and obesity.  The increase
            in obesity is slight as poverty increases, and obesity rates are in a very small
            range of percentages so it is hard to tell.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no visible correlation between age and obesity.  The scatter plot is just
            a circular blob and at any given median age you can find states with very different
            obesity rates.
